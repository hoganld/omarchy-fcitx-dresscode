# Omarchy FCITX5 Themes

I love Omarchy. I love Fcitx5 less, but I need it every time I want to type in Japanese.

I wish they would play nicely together.

## What is the problem here?

Out of the box, Omarchy works great and *looks like a million bucks*. 

Fcitx works fine, but left to its own devices, its appearance is not suitable for mixed company.

This project is my attempt to dress up Fcitx5 to the point that it can be invited to the Omarchy party.

## What's in the box?

1. A set of color themes for Fcitx5 to coordinate with each of the default themes that ship with Omarchy.

2. A script to update the Fcitx5 theme.

3. A patch to call this new Fcitx5 theme update script from within Omarchy's `bin/omarchy-theme-set` script, so that updating the theme from Omarchy's native utilities also updates Fcitx5.

4. A set of scripts to install the themes and patch the Omarchy update script

5. A set of templates and scripts to facilitate the creation of new Fcitx5 themes, so you can add your own themes, and so I can keep up as DHH accepts new themes into Omarchy.
